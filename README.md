## Concept

This Chrome extension concept is pretty simple: Unleash Chrome users to launch and start chat sessions on ChatGPT by OpenAI web application from anywhere through a NOT SUPPORTED BY DEFAULT query parameter `q` that automagically fill the ChatGPT input field and trigger the chat session for you.

```

## Using via Chrome Web Store

Chrome Web Store is reviewing it. As soon as it gets approved by them, you will be able to install it like any other Chrome extension through a Chrome Web Store link.
