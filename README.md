## How to use

This Chrome extension concept is pretty simple. The idea is that using this extension, Chrome users will be able to load queries on ChatGPT by OpenAI website from anywhere throught a brand new query parameter `q` that automagically fill the ChatGPT and submit that query.

```
https://chat.openai.com/chat?q={Query}
```

Chrome Web Store is reviewing it. As soon as it gets approved by them, you will be able to install it like any other Chrome extension through a Chrome Web Store link.
