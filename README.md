# ChatGPT Quicklink Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension to enable quicklink for ChatGPT on Google Chrome.

## How to use

This Chrome extension concept is pretty simple. The idea is that using this extension, Chrome users will be able to load queries on ChatGPT by OpenAI website from anywhere throught a brand new query parameter `q` that automagically fill the ChatGPT and submit that query.

```
https://chat.openai.com/chat?q={Query}
```
